Question 2: Stability

Part a:

Our selection sort function is an unstable sort because sorted
values are not kept in the same relative ordering based on the
sequence of insertion. Rather, the order of equal elements are
up to the whims of the function's assortment. A swap may place
an element out of order of insertion but another swap may just
reverse that.

Part b:

The following output underlines the unstable nature of the
selection sort function:

pre: (10,start) (10,end) (2,2) (1,1) 
post: (1,1) (2,2) (10,end) (10,start)

The pair (10,start) swaps with (1,1) on the first move and 
(10,end) swaps with (2,2) on the second move. The resulting
order is unsorted because although (10,start) is inserted
first, it is actually after (10,end) after selection sort is
called.
